## Final Term Paper

 - Revise the final term paper based on the feedback on previous term paper parts and presentation.
 - Deliverables: A TPF.pdf file
 - It needs to be properly formated (it is highly recommended to use a latex template).

## Paper Structure

### Title
Title needs to be concise and easy to understand. It should also describe the problem to solve (and how you solve it).

### Abstract
Try to use one sentence to answer each of the following questions:

 - What is the problem to solve? 
 - Why solving the problem? (Motivations) 
 - What are the challenges? (Optional) 
 - How are you going to solve it? Justify why your approach better solve the problem (and resolve the challenges).

### Introduction
Introduction will be the first section. It works as an extended version of the abstract. Use one paragraph to answer each question:

 - What is the problem to solve? Why solving the problem? (Motivations)
 - What are the challenges? (Optional)
 - How others have tried to solve this problem (or resolve the challenges)? What are their limitations?
 - How are you going to solve it? Justify why your approach better solve the problem (and resolve the challenges).
 - How do you demonstrate whether your approach better solve the problem in experiments?

**Note** that in the introduction, each claim needs to be supported by evidence such as references, theories, or experimental results.

### Background and Related Work
+ Related work for the problem
  - How others have tried to solve the problem (literature review)
  - Especially the baseline approaches you will compare against in the experiments, describe how it works in details.
+ Related work for your proposed approach (optional)
  - If you use techniques proposed by others, this is the place to describe those techniques and how they have been used to solve other problems.

### Methodology
Describe how you solve the problem in details. Highlight the differences between your approach and the existing baselines.

### Experiment
+ Data
  - Source and description of the data
  - How you plan to collect the data (optional)
+ Evaluation
  - Performance metrics
  - Statistical tests
+ Treatments
  - Baseline approaches from literature
  - Your approach
  - Different configurations of your approach (ablation studies)

### Expected Results
Describe what results will be considered as successful (success criteria).

### Discussion
Potential impacts (what do the results imply?), limitations, threats to validity.

### Conclusion
conclusions and future work.

## Scores
 | Criteria | Score |

 | A TPF.pdf file should be found under your _IDAI-720/termpaper/_ directory | 1 points|
 | Motivation: the problem is worth solving | 2 points |
 | Soundness: every claim is supported by evidence (references, theories, or experimental results) | 2 points |
 | Novelty: new knowledge will be generated from this research | 2 points |
 | Experimental Design: the expected results should be compelling to support your claim (of your approach better solve the problem) | 4 points |
 | Limitations: limitations of the proposed approach are properly analyzed | 2 points |
 | Presentation: paper is well-structured and easy to read. Should be free of typos and grammar errors. | 2 points |
