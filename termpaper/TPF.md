## Final Term Paper

 - Revise the final term paper based on the feedback on previous term paper parts and presentation.
 - Deliverables: A TPF.pdf file
 - It needs to be properly formated (it is highly recommended to use a latex template).

## Paper Structure

### Title
Title needs to be concise and easy to understand. It should also describe the problem to solve (and how you solve it).

### Abstract
Try to use one sentence to answer each of the following questions:

 - What is the problem to solve? 
 - Why solving the problem? (Motivations) 
 - What are the challenges? (Optional) 
 - How are you going to solve it? Justify why your approach better solve the problem (and resolve the challenges).

### Introduction
Introduction will be the first section. It works as an extended version of the abstract. Use one paragraph to answer each question:

 - What is the problem to solve? Why solving the problem? (Motivations)
 - What are the challenges? (Optional)
 - How others have tried to solve this problem (or resolve the challenges)? What are their limitations?
 - How are you going to solve it? Justify why your approach better solve the problem (and resolve the challenges).
 - How do you demonstrate whether your approach better solve the problem in experiments?

**Note** that in the introduction, each claim needs to be supported by evidence such as references, theories, or experimental results.

### Background and Related Work
+ Related work for the problem
  - How others have tried to solve the problem (literature review)
  - Especially the baseline approaches you will compare against in the experiments, describe how it works in details.
+ Related work for your proposed approach (optional)
  - If you use techniques proposed by others, this is the place to describe those techniques and how they have been used to solve other problems.

### Methodology
Describe how you solve the problem in details. Highlight the differences between your approach and the existing baselines.

### Experiment
+ Data
  - Source and description of the data
  - How you plan to collect the data (optional)
+ Evaluation
  - Performance metrics
  - Statistical tests
+ Treatments
  - Baseline approaches from literature
  - Your approach
  - Different configurations of your approach (ablation studies)

### Expected Results
Describe what results will be considered as successful (success criteria).

### Discussion
Potential impacts (what do the results imply?), limitations, threats to validity.

### Conclusion
conclusions and future work.

| Motivation          | 2     | Problem is worth solving. Solving the problem will largely benefit the society or advance the knowledge. Demonstrated with references or examples.                                                                                           |
|                     | 1     | Solving the problem will benefit the society or advance the knowledge to some extend.                                                                                                                                                        |
|                     | 0     | Not worth solving the problem at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Soundness           | 2     | Every claim is supported by evidence (references, theories, or experimental results)                                                                                                                                                         |
|                     | 1     | Most claims are supported by evidence (references, theories, or experimental results)                                                                                                                                                        |
|                     | 0     | Many claims are not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Novelty             | 2     | Proposed approach is completely novel or largely different from existing approaches in solving the target problem (applying an existing approach to solve a new problem is also considered as novel).                                        |
|                     | 1     | Proposed approach has incremental improvement over existing approaches in solving the target problem.                                                                                                                                        |
|                     | 0     | No novel contribution at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Experimental Design | 2     | The expected results are compelling to support your claim (of your approach better solve the problem).                                                                                                                                       |
|                     | 1     | The expected results only partially support the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                     | 0     | The expected results cannot support the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Feasibility         | 2     | It is promising to achieve the expected results (state-of-the-art approaches have large room to improve, or the proposed approach suits the problem well, or the proposed approach has been shown to perform well in similar problems, etc.) |
|                     | 1     | It is possible to achieve the expected results. There is also the risk of not performing better than the existing approaches.                                                                                                                |
|                     | 0     | It is unlikely to achieve the expected results.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Discussion          | 2     | Limitations of the proposed approach are properly analyzed and do not violate the claims.                                                                                                                                                    |
|                     | 1     | Some limitations are not successfully identified.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                     | 0     | There are critical limitations that are not identified (which may violate the claims).                                                                                                                                                       |
| Presentation        | 3     | Paper is well-structured and easy to read. Free of typos and grammar errors.                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                     | 2     | Paper is a bit hard to follow but still understandable. May have typos or grammar errors.                                                                                                                                                   |
|                     | 1     | Paper is not well-structured and makes it difficult to understand.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                     | 0     | Paper is poorly written and does not follow the provided template at all.                                                                                                                                                                    |
